LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting

Objective: Analyze the attached LoadRunner response time results table along with the param sheet and generate a comprehensive HTML performance summary report.

Requirements:

1. SLA Compliance Check Table (Based on Functionality)

Use the param sheet which contains:

Transaction Name

Functionality

Transaction Type

Calls


Join this data with the LoadRunner 90th percentile response time results.

For each row:

If Transaction Type = main, place it under Transaction Name.

If not, place it under Sub Transaction Name.


Add a URL column for each Transaction Name.

Compare the 90th percentile response time with the SLA target (default SLA = 3 seconds unless specified).

Show SLA compliance status ("Under SLA" / "SLA Breached").

Make the table filterable/searchable in the HTML report.



2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions

Identify the top 5 transactions (by 90th percentile response time).

Include Transaction Name, Functionality, Response Time, and SLA Status.



3. Graph

Create a bar chart of the Top 5 slowest transactions by 90th percentile response time.

Y-axis: Response time (seconds)

X-axis: Transaction Name
