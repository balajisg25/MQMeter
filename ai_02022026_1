Task
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by programmatically reading all data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Copilot (Microsoft 365).
All values displayed in the HTML must be read directly from the Excel sheets. Do not fabricate, approximate, summarize, or infer numeric values. If a cell exists in Excel, its exact value must be rendered in the HTML.
Excel Sheet Detection and Parsing (Critical)
Automatically detect all worksheets whose names match exactly:
Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Do not hardcode release names or assume a fixed number of releases.
Extract the release identifier dynamically (M1, M2, M3, …) from the sheet name.
Iterate through every detected Release M* - Response Time sheet.
For each Response Time sheet:
Locate and parse all populated rows and columns.
Preserve numeric precision (do not round unless Excel already does).
Treat empty cells as empty (do not replace with 0 or N/A unless Excel explicitly contains those values).
For each release, associate and load the matching Release M* - Graph sheet.
All detected releases must be rendered. Do not limit output to the latest or a single release.
HTML Layout and Styling
Full-width layout (100% browser width)
No left or right white margins
Light theme only:
White or light-gray background
Soft blue, green, and red accent colors
Card-based layout with subtle shadows
Responsive design for desktop and laptop screens
Sticky table headers
Zebra-striped rows
Row hover highlighting
Homepage / Executive Summary (All Releases)
Build this section only from parsed Excel data.
For each release, calculate and display:
Total number of transactions (count of parsed rows)
Average response time (mean of Average Response Time column)
SLA status summary (count of Under SLA vs Breached)
Include navigation links that scroll to each release section.
Per-Release Section (Repeat for Every Release)
1. SLA Compliance Table
Data Source: Release M* - Response Time sheet
Tree View Grouping (derived from Excel columns):
Functionality → Transaction → Sub-Transaction
Functionality is used only for grouping and must NOT appear as a visible column.
Table State:
Fully expanded by default
Columns (mapped exactly from Excel headers):
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
Table Features:
Expand / collapse all
Global search across all columns
Per-column filtering
Column show / hide selector
Sticky headers
SLA Status Styling:
Green = Under SLA
Red = SLA Breached
Use the SLA Status value exactly as present in Excel
Do not introduce SLA thresholds or user configuration
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Derived strictly from parsed Excel data
Sort all rows by 90th Percentile Response Time (descending)
Select the top 5
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
3. Top-5 90th Percentile Performance Graph
Bar chart using the same Top-5 dataset
X-axis: Transaction or Sub-Transaction name (from Excel)
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time (seconds)
Light theme colors
Hover tooltips showing exact values
Smooth animations
4. Release Graph Sheet Content (Mandatory)
Immediately below the Top-5 chart, render all content from the matching Release M* - Graph sheet:
Text
Tables
Images
Charts
Render content exactly as it appears in Excel.
Do not summarize, reinterpret, or relocate this content.
It must appear under its corresponding release section only.
5. Observations and Recommendations
Generate this section based only on parsed data:
Identify SLA breaches
Highlight consistently slow transactions
Provide clear, client-friendly recommendations
Deliverable
Single, self-contained HTML file
Embedded or CDN-based CSS and JavaScript
Fully interactive tables and charts
Automatically adapts when new releases (M3, M4, etc.) are added
Constraints (Strict)
No Python or backend scripting
No HTML file upload controls
No hardcoded release names
No SLA threshold configuration
All detected releases must be displayed
All numeric and text values must come directly from Excel
Graph sheet content must appear under the correct release
If any Excel data cannot be read, explicitly state which sheet, row, or column failed instead of skipping it.
