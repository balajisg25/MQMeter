Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report from a LoadRunner Excel file uploaded in Copilot (Microsoft 365).
Excel Sheet Processing
Automatically detect all worksheets matching:
Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Do not hardcode any release names.
Iterate over every matching Release M* - Response Time sheet.
For each detected release (M1, M2, M3, and so on):
Create a dedicated section in the HTML.
Associate and read the matching Release M* - Graph sheet.
All detected releases must be rendered in the report.
Do not display only the latest or a single release.
