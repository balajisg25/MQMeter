Generate a fully self-contained, light-themed, interactive HTML performance report for LoadRunner test results with multiple releases. The report should consolidate data per release and include SLA compliance, top slow transactions, and graphs. 

Requirements:

1. **Homepage / Executive Summary**
- Show a high-level summary of all releases (M1, M2, M3, etc.)
- Include total number of transactions, average response time, SLA compliance summary
- Provide navigation to each release section

2. **Per Release Sections**
For each release (M1, M2, M3, ...):

a) **SLA Compliance Table**
- Tree view grouped by Functionality > Transaction > Sub-Transaction
- Columns:
  - Transaction Name
  - Sub Transaction Name
  - URL
  - Minimum Response Time
  - Maximum Response Time
  - Average Response Time
  - 90th Percentile Response Time
  - SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
- SLA target = 3 seconds (default)
- Behavior:
  - Functionality acts as parent, not shown as column
  - Load fully expanded by default
  - Expand/Collapse All buttons
  - Global search
  - Per-column filters
  - Column show/hide selector
- SLA Status color-coded:
  - Green → Under SLA
  - Red → SLA Breached

b) **Top 5 Slowest Transactions Table**
- Columns:
  - Transaction Name
  - Sub Transaction Name
  - 90th Percentile Response Time
  - SLA Status (color-coded)
- Sort by 90th percentile response time descending

c) **Performance Graph**
- Bar chart for Top 5 slowest transactions
- X-axis: Transaction/Sub Transaction Name
- Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time (seconds)
- Soft, light-theme colors
- Tooltips and hover effects
- Smooth animations

3. **Observations & Recommendations**
- Section with summary observations
- Recommendations based on SLA breaches or slowest transactions

4. **UI/UX & Styling Requirements**
- Light theme only (white/light gray background)
- Soft accent colors (blue/green/red)
- Card-based sections with subtle shadows
- Clean typography
- Sticky table headers
- Zebra-striped rows
- Row hover highlighting
- Expand/Collapse icons for tree nodes
- Column chooser / visibility toggle
- Smooth but minimal animations
- Responsive design

5. **Deliverable**
- Single self-contained HTML file
- Includes CSS and JS (Bootstrap/Tailwind or equivalent)
- Fully interactive tables and charts
- Optimized for presentation and client review

**Additional Instructions:**
- Include all releases (M1, M2, M3, …) in one report
- Each release should have its own SLA table and graph
- Homepage should provide consolidated overview and quick navigation
- Use placeholder sample data for demonstration (can be replaced later)
