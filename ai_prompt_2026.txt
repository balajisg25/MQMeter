LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting
Objective
Analyze the provided LoadRunner response time results and parameter sheet to generate a modern, visually polished, and interactive HTML performance summary report suitable for executive and stakeholder review.
Requirements
1. SLA Compliance Table (Stylish Tree View by Functionality)
Create an SLA Compliance table displayed fully expanded by default, structured as a tree view grouped by Functionality.
Hierarchy Structure:
Level 1: Functionality
Level 2: Transaction Name (Main)
Level 3: Sub Transaction Name (Child)
Data Display Rules:
Display performance values at the lowest available level
Main transaction shows values if no sub-transactions exist
Sub-transactions display values when present
Functionality rows may remain non-metric parent nodes
Displayed Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
Behavior & Rules:
Default SLA target = 3 seconds, unless overridden
Functionality used as a tree parent, not as a visible column
Table must:
Load fully expanded
Provide Expand All / Collapse All controls
Support global search
Support individual column-level filters
SLA Status must be color-coded with badges or icons
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Identify the Top 5 slowest transactions based on 90th percentile response time.
Include:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (color-coded)
3. Performance Graph
Create a clean, professional bar chart for the Top 5 slowest transactions:
X-axis: Transaction / Sub Transaction Name
Y-axis: Response Time (seconds)
Metric: 90th Percentile Response Time
Use modern colors, tooltips, and hover effects
4. HTML Performance Report (UI & Styling Requirements)
The HTML report must be:
Responsive and modern
Styled using CSS3 / Bootstrap / Tailwind or equivalent
Visually consistent with corporate dashboards
Mandatory Styling Elements:
Clean typography and spacing
Section cards with subtle shadows
Sticky table headers
Zebra-striped rows
Hover highlights for rows
SLA status shown as colored pills or badges
Expand/Collapse icons for tree nodes
Smooth transitions/animations (optional)
5. Report Sections
Executive Summary (high-level insights with highlights)
SLA Compliance Table
Functionality-based tree view
Fully expanded by default
Expand/Collapse All
Per-column filters
Top 5 Response Time Table
Performance Bar Chart (embedded via Chart.js or Base64)
