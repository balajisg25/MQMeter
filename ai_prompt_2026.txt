LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting
Objective
Analyze the provided LoadRunner response time results and parameter sheet to generate a modern, light-themed, stylish, and interactive HTML performance summary report suitable for executive and stakeholder review.
Requirements
1. SLA Compliance Table (Functionality Tree View with Column Controls)
Create an SLA Compliance table displayed fully expanded by default, structured as a tree view grouped by Functionality.
Hierarchy Structure:
Level 1: Functionality
Level 2: Transaction Name (Main)
Level 3: Sub Transaction Name (Child)
Data Display Rules:
Display performance values at the lowest available level
Main transaction shows values if no sub-transactions exist
Sub-transactions display values when present
Functionality rows act as logical parent nodes (no mandatory metrics)
Displayed Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
Behavior & Rules:
Default SLA target = 3 seconds, unless overridden
Functionality is used as a tree parent, not shown as a column
The table must:
Load fully expanded
Provide Expand All / Collapse All
Support global search
Support individual column-level filters
Provide a column show/hide selector so users can hide unwanted columns
SLA Status must be color-coded (light theme):
Green badge → Under SLA
Red badge → SLA Breached
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Identify the Top 5 slowest transactions based on 90th percentile response time.
Include:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (color-coded)
3. Performance Graph
Create a clean, professional bar chart for the Top 5 slowest transactions:
X-axis: Transaction / Sub Transaction Name
Y-axis: Response Time (seconds)
Metric: 90th Percentile Response Time
Use soft, light-theme colors with tooltips and hover effects
4. HTML Performance Report (Light Theme & UX Requirements)
The HTML report must:
Use a light color theme only (no dark mode)
Be responsive and modern
Use CSS3 / Bootstrap / Tailwind or equivalent
Mandatory UI/UX Styling:
White / light gray background
Soft accent colors (blue/green/red)
Clean typography
Card-based sections with subtle shadows
Sticky table headers
Zebra-striped rows
Row hover highlighting
Expand/Collapse icons for tree nodes
Column chooser / visibility toggle
Smooth but minimal animations
5. Report Sections
Executive Summary
SLA Compliance Table
Functionality-based tree view
Fully expanded by default
Expand/Collapse All
Per-column filters
Column show/hide option
Top 5 Response Time Table
Performance Bar Chart
Observations & Recommendations
Deliverable
A single, self-contained, light-themed HTML report
Optimized for presentation, sharing, and client review
