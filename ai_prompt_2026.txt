LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting
Objective
Analyze the provided LoadRunner response time results and parameter sheet to generate a comprehensive, interactive HTML performance summary report.
Requirements
1. SLA Compliance Table (Tree View by Functionality)
Create an SLA Compliance table structured as a tree view grouped by Functionality.
Hierarchy:
Level 1: Functionality
Level 2: Transaction Name (if Transaction Type = Main)
Level 3: Sub Transaction Name (if Transaction Type ≠ Main)
Displayed Columns (Leaf Level Only):
Transaction Name (Main transactions only)
Sub Transaction Name (Sub transactions only)
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
Rules:
Default SLA target = 3 seconds, unless explicitly overridden in the parameter sheet.
Functionality is used as the tree parent node, not as a visible data column.
The tree view must be expandable/collapsible and searchable/filterable across all fields in the HTML report.
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Identify the Top 5 slowest transactions based on 90th percentile response time, regardless of functionality grouping.
Include:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
3. Performance Graph
Generate a bar chart for the Top 5 slowest transactions:
X-axis: Transaction Name (or Sub Transaction Name, where applicable)
Y-axis: Response Time (seconds)
Metric: 90th Percentile Response Time
4. HTML Performance Report
The final HTML report must include the following sections:
Executive Summary
SLA Compliance Tree View (Functionality-based, expandable)
Top 5 Response Time Table
Bar Chart (embedded using Chart.js or Base64)
Observations and Recommendations
Deliverable
A single, self-contained HTML report suitable for sharing with stakeholders.
