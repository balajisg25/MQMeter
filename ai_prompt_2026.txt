LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting
Objective
Analyze the provided LoadRunner response time results and parameter sheet to generate a comprehensive, interactive HTML performance summary report.
Requirements
1. SLA Compliance Table
Create an SLA Compliance table with the following columns only:
Transaction Name (populate only if Transaction Type = Main)
Sub Transaction Name (populate if Transaction Type ≠ Main)
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
Rules:
Default SLA target = 3 seconds, unless explicitly overridden in the parameter sheet.
Transactions should be grouped by functionality internally, but Functionality must not be displayed in the table.
The table must be searchable and filterable across all columns in the HTML report.
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Identify the Top 5 slowest transactions based on 90th percentile response time.
Include:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
3. Performance Graph
Generate a bar chart for the Top 5 slowest transactions:
X-axis: Transaction Name (or Sub Transaction Name, where applicable)
Y-axis: Response Time (seconds)
Metric: 90th Percentile Response Time
4. HTML Performance Report
The final HTML report must include the following sections:
Executive Summary
SLA Compliance Table (searchable & filterable)
Top 5 Response Time Table
Bar Chart (embedded using Chart.js or Base64)
Observations and Recommendations
Deliverable
A single, self-contained HTML report suitable for sharing with stakeholders.
