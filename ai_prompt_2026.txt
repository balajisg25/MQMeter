LoadRunner Test Analysis and Performance Reporting
Objective
Analyze the provided LoadRunner response time results and parameter sheet to generate a comprehensive, interactive HTML performance summary report.
Requirements
1. SLA Compliance Table (Functionality Tree View with Column Filters)
Create an SLA Compliance table displayed fully expanded by default, structured as a tree view grouped by Functionality.
Hierarchy Structure:
Level 1: Functionality
Level 2: Transaction Name (if Transaction Type = Main)
Level 3: Sub Transaction Name (if Transaction Type ≠ Main)
Displayed Columns (Leaf Nodes):
Transaction Name (Main only)
Sub Transaction Name (Sub only)
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached)
Behavior & Rules:
Default SLA target = 3 seconds, unless overridden in the parameter sheet.
Functionality is used only as the tree parent node, not shown as a data column.
The table must:
Load in a fully expanded state
Provide Expand All / Collapse All controls
Support global search
Support individual column-level filtering for each column
SLA Status must be visually highlighted (e.g., green for Under SLA, red for SLA Breached).
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Identify the Top 5 slowest transactions based on 90th percentile response time, regardless of functionality.
Include:
Transaction Name
Sub Transaction Name
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
3. Performance Graph
Generate a bar chart for the Top 5 slowest transactions:
X-axis: Transaction Name (or Sub Transaction Name where applicable)
Y-axis: Response Time (seconds)
Metric: 90th Percentile Response Time
4. HTML Performance Report
The final HTML report must include the following sections:
Executive Summary
SLA Compliance Table
Functionality-based tree view
Fully expanded by default
Expand/Collapse All
Per-column filters
Top 5 Response Time Table
Bar Chart (embedded using Chart.js or Base64)
Observations and Recommendations
Deliverable
A single, self-contained HTML report suitable for sharing with stakeholders.
