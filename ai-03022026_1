Task
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by accurately reading and rendering data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Copilot (Microsoft 365).
The HTML must follow the same logical order and structure as the provided Excel sample.
Sheet Detection (No Hardcoding)
Automatically detect and parse:
consolidated sheet
param sheet
All sheets matching:
Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Do not hardcode release names. Detect all available releases dynamically (M1, M2, M3, …).
Data Sources & Mapping Rules
1. Consolidated Sheet (Primary Summary – MUST BE FIRST)
Treat the consolidated sheet as the homepage summary table
Read and render the consolidated table exactly as it appears in Excel
Preserve:
Row order
Column order
Cell values
NA / blank values
Do not recalculate or alter consolidated values
2. Param Sheet (Metadata Join)
Use the param sheet to enrich transaction data.
Columns:
Transaction Name (Primary Key)
Functionality
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Join Rules (Critical):
Join using Transaction Name
Trim whitespace and normalize case before matching
If no match is found, leave fields blank
Do not infer or fabricate metadata
3. Release M* – Response Time Sheets
For each detected Release M* - Response Time sheet:
Parse all populated rows
Convert numeric columns to numbers:
Minimum
Average
Maximum
90th Percentile
Ignore Pass / Fail / Stop columns for SLA logic
SLA Status (Derived in HTML)
SLA Status must NOT be read from Excel
Add SLA Status dynamically
Rule:
Under SLA → 90th Percentile ≤ 3 seconds
SLA Breached → 90th Percentile > 3 seconds
Apply SLA consistently to:
Tables
Charts
Observations
HTML Report Structure (Strict Order)
1️⃣ Consolidated Section (FIRST)
Display the entire consolidated sheet table
Full-width table
Sticky headers
Zebra striping
Row hover highlighting
2️⃣ Consolidated Bar Chart (Immediately After Table)
Create a bar chart based on the consolidated table
X-axis: Functionalities / Transactions (as per consolidated sheet)
Y-axis: Response Time values
Color code bars:
Green ≤ 3s
Red > 3s
Hover tooltips showing exact values
3️⃣ Per-Release Detailed Reports (After Consolidated)
Repeat the following for every detected release (M1, M2, …):
Per-Release Section – Release M*
A. SLA Compliance Table
Data Source:
Release M* - Response Time + param sheet
Tree Grouping:
Functionality → Transaction → Sub-Transaction
Functionality used only for grouping (not a visible column)
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
Features:
Fully expanded by default
Expand / collapse all
Global search
Per-column filtering
Column show/hide
Sticky headers
SLA Styling:
Green = Under SLA
Red = SLA Breached
B. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Derived from Release M* data
Sorted by 90th Percentile (descending)
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
90th Percentile
SLA Status
C. Top 5 – 90th Percentile Bar Chart
Bar chart of Top 5 slowest transactions
X-axis: Transaction / Sub-Transaction
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time
Light theme colors
Smooth animations
Hover tooltips
D. Release M* – Graph Sheet Content
Render all content from the matching Release M* - Graph sheet
Maintain same format as Excel:
Titles
Charts
Tables
Layout order
Place this section immediately after the release’s charts
Do not summarize or reinterpret
E. Observations & Recommendations
Identify SLA breaches (>3s)
Highlight slow or degrading transactions
Provide client-friendly recommendations
Styling & Layout
100% browser width
No side white space
Light theme only:
White / light-gray background
Soft blue, green, red accents
Card-based sections with subtle shadows
Responsive design
Constraints (Strict)
No backend or Python scripting
No HTML upload controls
No hardcoded release names
SLA fixed at 3 seconds
Consolidated sheet must appear FIRST
All detected releases must be rendered
Values must come directly from Excel or derived explicitly
If data cannot be parsed, clearly report the missing sheet or column
Do not fabricate, approximate, or skip data.
