Create a fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report that consolidates LoadRunner test results from an Excel file. The report should support multiple releases and include SLA compliance, top slow transactions, and performance graphs.
Requirements:
Input Excel File Handling
The Excel file contains multiple sheets:
Release response time sheets: Release M1 - Response Time, Release M2 - Response Time, …, with future releases following the regex pattern Release M.* - Response Time.
Release graph sheets: Release M1 - Graph, Release M2 - Graph, …, with future releases following the regex pattern Release M.* - Graph.
Each release may have corresponding graph data and descriptive text to include in the report.
The script should automatically detect all sheets matching the above patterns.
Homepage / Executive Summary
Display a high-level summary of all releases (M1, M2, M3, …) with:
Total transactions
Average response time
SLA compliance summary
Provide quick navigation links to each release section.
Per Release Sections
For each release:
a) SLA Compliance Table
Tree-view grouped by Functionality > Transaction > Sub-Transaction
Columns:
Transaction Name, Sub Transaction Name, URL
Minimum Response Time, Maximum Response Time, Average Response Time, 90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (Under SLA / SLA Breached) – SLA = 3 seconds (default)
Features:
Expand/Collapse all buttons
Fully expanded by default
Global search, per-column filters, column visibility toggle
Color-coded SLA Status: Green → Under SLA, Red → Breached
b) Top 5 Slowest Transactions Table
Columns: Transaction Name, Sub Transaction Name, 90th Percentile Response Time, SLA Status
Sort descending by 90th percentile response time
Color-coded SLA Status
c) Performance Graph
Bar chart for top 5 slowest transactions
X-axis: Transaction/Sub Transaction Name, Y-axis: 90th percentile response time
Soft, light-theme colors, hover tooltips, smooth animations
Include release-specific graph images or generated charts from the Excel data
Observations & Recommendations
Section summarizing observations and recommendations
Recommendations based on SLA breaches or slow transactions
UI/UX & Styling
Light theme: white/light gray background, soft accent colors (blue/green/red)
Card-based layout with subtle shadows
Sticky table headers, zebra-striped rows, hover highlighting
Expand/Collapse icons for tree nodes
Column chooser / visibility toggle
Smooth but minimal animations
Responsive design
Deliverable
Single self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JS (Bootstrap, Tailwind, or equivalent)
Fully interactive tables and charts
Placeholder sample data for demonstration (later replaceable by Excel data)
Each release section dynamically populated based on Excel sheets
Automation / Extensibility
Automatically detect all existing and future release sheets using regex: Release M.* - Response Time and Release M.* - Graph
Load the corresponding response time data and graphs for each release
Support adding future releases without changing the code
