TASK
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by accurately reading and rendering data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Microsoft Copilot (M365).
The HTML report must strictly follow the logical order, hierarchy, and structure of the provided Excel sample.
No assumptions, approximations, or fabricated data are allowed.
SHEET DETECTION (NO HARDCODING)
Automatically detect and parse the following sheets:
consolidated
param
All sheets matching the patterns: Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Do not hardcode release names.
Releases must be detected dynamically (M1, M2, M3, etc.).
DATA SOURCES AND MAPPING RULES
CONSOLIDATED SHEET (PRIMARY SUMMARY – MUST BE FIRST)
Treat the consolidated sheet as the homepage summary.
Render the table exactly as it appears in Excel.
Preserve:
Row order
Column order
Cell values
NA and blank values
Do not recalculate, normalize, or modify any values.
PARAM SHEET (METADATA JOIN)
Used to enrich transaction data.
Columns:
Transaction Name (Primary Key)
Functionality
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Join Rules:
Join using Transaction Name
Trim whitespace and normalize case before matching
If no match is found, leave fields blank
Do not infer, guess, or fabricate metadata
RELEASE M* - RESPONSE TIME SHEETS
For each detected release:
Parsing Rules:
Read all populated rows
Convert numeric columns: Minimum Average Maximum 90th Percentile
Ignore: Pass Fail Stop
SLA STATUS (DERIVED IN HTML ONLY)
SLA must not be read from Excel.
SLA threshold is fixed at 3 seconds.
Rule:
Under SLA if 90th Percentile is less than or equal to 3 seconds
SLA Breached if 90th Percentile is greater than 3 seconds
Apply SLA consistently to tables, charts, observations, and recommendations.
HTML REPORT STRUCTURE (STRICT ORDER)
CONSOLIDATED SECTION (FIRST)
Display the entire consolidated sheet table
Full width table
Sticky headers
Zebra striping
Row hover highlighting
No pagination
Exact Excel layout preserved
CONSOLIDATED BAR CHART (IMMEDIATELY AFTER TABLE)
X-axis: Functionalities or Transactions as per consolidated sheet
Y-axis: Response Time values
Color rules: Green for values less than or equal to 3 seconds Red for values greater than 3 seconds
Hover tooltips showing exact values
PER-RELEASE DETAILED SECTIONS (FOR EVERY DETECTED RELEASE)
PER-RELEASE SECTION – RELEASE M*
A. RESPONSE TIME AND SLA COMPLIANCE TABLE (FUNCTIONALITY GROUPED AND EXPANDABLE)
Data Source:
Release M* - Response Time sheet
Param sheet
Grouping and Expand/Collapse Rules:
Group rows by Functionality
Each Functionality is a collapsible parent section
Tables must be collapsed by default at the functionality level
Each functionality can be expanded individually
Provide Expand All and Collapse All controls
Hierarchy: Functionality Transaction Name (Main Call) Sub-Transaction Name (Sub Call)
Visibility Rules:
Functionality must not appear as a table column
Functionality appears only as a group header
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
Table Features:
Sticky headers
Global search across all functionalities
Per-column filtering
Column show/hide
Responsive layout
SLA Styling:
Green for Under SLA
Red for SLA Breached
B. TOP 5 SLOWEST TRANSACTIONS
Derived from the entire release data
Sorted by 90th Percentile in descending order
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
90th Percentile
SLA Status
C. TOP 5 – 90TH PERCENTILE BAR CHART
X-axis: Transaction or Sub-Transaction
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time
Light theme colors
Smooth animations
Hover tooltips
D. RELEASE M* - GRAPH SHEET CONTENT
Render all content from the Release M* - Graph sheet
Maintain original titles, charts, tables, and layout order
Do not summarize, reinterpret, or alter the content
E. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Identify SLA breaches greater than 3 seconds
Highlight slow or degrading transactions
Provide clear, client-friendly, actionable recommendations
STYLING AND LAYOUT
100 percent browser width
No side white space
Light theme only
White or light gray background
Soft blue, green, and red accents
Card-based layout
Subtle shadows
Fully responsive design
CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)
No backend or Python scripting
No HTML upload controls
No hardcoded release names
SLA value must remain 3 seconds
Consolidated section must appear first
All detected releases must be rendered
All values must come directly from Excel or be explicitly derived
If any required sheet or column is missing, clearly report it in the HTML
Do not fabricate, approximate, or skip any data
