Plain Text Prompt with Easy Top Navigation
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive HTML performance report from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Copilot (Microsoft 365). Include a sticky top navigation header with quick links to:
Consolidated Table
Consolidated Response Time Bar Chart
Each detected release section (e.g., M1, M2, …)
Observations & Recommendations
The header must remain visible while scrolling, and clicking a link should smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.
Consolidated Sheet (Homepage / Executive Summary)
Use the entire consolidated sheet.
First three rows are table headers.
Full table rendered in HTML.
Add a Consolidated Response Time Bar Chart immediately below the table:
X-axis: transaction / functionality names, shortened for laptop view.
Y-axis: response time.
Include filtering options for columns or ranges.
Bar colors: Green ≤3s, Red >3s.
Param Sheet Mapping (Transaction Metadata)
Use Param sheet to enrich each transaction (Transaction Name, Functionality, Sub-Transaction Name, URL).
Join Release M* - Response Time sheets with Param sheet by Transaction Name.
Main calls: Transaction Name column, URL empty.
Sub-transactions: Sub-Transaction Name column, URL populated.
Trim and normalize all strings before matching.
SLA Compliance Table (Per Release)
Grouping: Functionality → Transaction → Sub-Transaction (Functionality only for grouping, not a column).
Columns: Transaction Name / Sub-Transaction Name, URL (empty for main calls), Min, Max, Avg, 90th Percentile, SLA Status (≤3s = Under SLA, >3s = SLA Breached).
Features: Expand/collapse all, search, per-column filter, column show/hide (hide unnecessary columns by default).
SLA Status styling: Green = Under SLA, Red = SLA Breached.
Top 5 Slowest Transactions & 90th Percentile Graph
Derived from Release M* data, sorted by 90th percentile descending.
Bar chart X-axis: Transaction / Sub-Transaction names (shortened).
Hover tooltips and smooth animations.
Release M – Graph Sheet Content*
Include all content from Release M* – Graph sheet exactly as in Excel: text, tables, charts, images.
Images must load correctly.
Place this section immediately after the release charts and tables.
Observations & Recommendations
Highlight SLA breaches (>3s) and slow transactions.
Provide client-friendly recommendations.
Layout and Styling
Sticky top navigation header with links to all major sections.
Full browser width, no side padding.
Light theme: white/light-gray background, soft blue/green/red accents.
Card-based layout with subtle shadows.
Tables: sticky headers, zebra stripes, row hover highlight.
Responsive design for laptops and larger screens.
Constraints
No backend or Python scripting.
No HTML file upload controls.
No hardcoded release names.
SLA fixed at 3 seconds.
All values must come directly from Excel or derived dynamically.
Clearly report missing or unparseable sheets.
