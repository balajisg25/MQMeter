Role: You are a Performance Test Expert skilled in LoadRunner analysis and Excel-based reporting.

Objective: Analyze the LoadRunner response time data and generate a structured Excel performance summary report.

Requirements:

1. SLA Compliance Analysis:

For each transaction, evaluate the 90th percentile response time against the SLA threshold (default SLA = 3 seconds unless specified).

Add a new column labeled "SLA Status" with values:

"Under SLA" if 90th percentile ≤ SLA

"SLA Breached" if 90th percentile > SLA




2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions:

Create a new sheet or section showing the Top 5 transactions with the highest 90th percentile response times.

Include columns: Transaction Name, 90th Percentile, SLA, SLA Status



3. Graph:

Insert a bar chart representing the Top 5 response times.

X-axis: Transaction names

Y-axis: 90th percentile response times (in seconds)

Title: "Top 5 Slowest Transactions by 90th Percentile"



4. Excel Formatting:

Use conditional formatting on the SLA Status column:

Green fill for “Under SLA”

Red fill for “SLA Breached”


Add filters to each column header

Bold and center titles




Input: LoadRunner response time table (CSV or Excel format) with columns like:

Transaction Name

Average Response Time

90th Percentile Response Time

Minimum

Maximum

Standard Deviation


Output: A professional Excel workbook (.xlsx) with:

Summary sheet (SLA Analysis)

Top 5 sheet

Embedded bar chart

Clear formatting and insights ready for stakeholders
