Task
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by reading and correlating data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Copilot (Microsoft 365).
All numeric values must come directly from Excel.
SLA Status must be derived inside HTML logic using 3 seconds as the threshold.
Functionality, Sub-Transaction, and URL must be sourced from the Param sheet via Transaction Name.
Excel Sheet Detection and Parsing
Detect all worksheets matching:
Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Detect and parse Param sheet
Columns (exact headers):
Transaction Name (Primary Key)
Functionality
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Data Correlation
For every row in Release M* - Response Time:
Use Transaction Name as join key
Lookup matching Param sheet row
Populate:
Functionality
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
If no match, leave blank
SLA Status Derivation
Add SLA Status column dynamically in HTML
Rule:
Under SLA → 90th Percentile Response Time ≤ 3 seconds
SLA Breached → 90th Percentile Response Time > 3 seconds
Apply consistently across:
SLA Compliance Table
Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Executive Summary
No SLA thresholds or user input
HTML Layout
Full browser width
Light theme: white/light-gray background
Soft blue, green, red accents
Card-based layout, subtle shadows
Responsive, sticky headers, zebra stripes, hover highlighting
Homepage / Executive Summary
For each release:
Total transactions
Average response time
SLA summary (Under SLA / SLA Breached, based on 3s threshold)
Include navigation links to each release section.
Per-Release Section
1. SLA Compliance Table
Data: Release M* - Response Time + Param sheet
Tree view grouping: Functionality → Transaction → Sub-Transaction
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name (from Param)
URL (from Param)
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status (derived using ≤3s)
Table features: Expand/collapse all, global search, per-column filter, show/hide columns, sticky headers
SLA Status styling: Green = Under SLA, Red = SLA Breached
2. Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Sorted by 90th Percentile Response Time (descending)
Columns: Transaction Name, Sub-Transaction Name, 90th Percentile Response Time, SLA Status
3. Top-5 90th Percentile Performance Graph
Bar chart of Top-5 slowest transactions
X-axis: Transaction/Sub-Transaction
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time
Light colors, hover tooltips, smooth animations
4. Release Graph Sheet Content
Render all content from matching Release M* - Graph sheet (text, tables, images, charts) exactly
5. Observations & Recommendations
Highlight SLA breaches (>3s)
Highlight slow transactions
Provide clear, client-friendly recommendations
Deliverable
Single self-contained HTML file
Embedded/CDN CSS & JS
Interactive tables & charts
Fully automatic for all detected releases
Constraints
No Python/backend scripting
No HTML upload controls
No hardcoded release names
Param sheet must be used for metadata
SLA Status must be derived (≤3s = Under SLA)
All detected releases must be rendered
