Generate a fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report that reads a LoadRunner test results Excel file uploaded in Copilot / M365.
Requirements:
1. File Handling
The Excel file will be uploaded in M365 Copilot (via OneDrive or local upload).
Detect all sheets automatically:
Response time sheets: Release M1 - Response Time, Release M2 - Response Time, … (future releases follow regex Release M.* - Response Time)
Graph sheets: Release M1 - Graph, Release M2 - Graph, … (future releases follow regex Release M.* - Graph)
Extract response time data and graph data per release for report generation.
2. Report Layout
Full-page layout: the HTML should use 100% browser width, no left/right whitespace.
Light theme: white/light gray background, soft accent colors (blue/green/red).
Card-based sections with subtle shadows.
Sticky table headers, zebra-striped rows, row hover highlighting.
Responsive design, smooth minimal animations.
3. Homepage / Executive Summary
High-level summary of all releases (M1, M2, M3, …):
Total transactions
Average response time
SLA compliance summary
Quick navigation links to each release section.
4. Per Release Sections
a) SLA Compliance Table
Tree view grouped by Functionality > Transaction > Sub-Transaction
Columns: Transaction Name, Sub Transaction Name, URL, Min/Max/Avg/90th Percentile Response Time, SLA Status (SLA = 3s default)
SLA Status color-coded: Green = Under SLA, Red = Breached
Expand/Collapse all buttons, fully expanded by default
Global search, per-column filters, column visibility toggle
b) Top 5 Slowest Transactions Table
Sorted by 90th percentile response time descending
Color-coded SLA Status
c) Performance Graph
Bar chart for top 5 slowest transactions per release
X-axis: Transaction/Sub Transaction Name, Y-axis: 90th percentile response time
Soft colors, tooltips, hover effects, smooth animations
Include release-specific graph images or charts from Excel sheets
5. Observations & Recommendations
Section summarizing observations
Recommendations based on SLA breaches or slowest transactions
6. Deliverable
Single self-contained HTML file
Full-width layout (no side whitespace)
Embedded CSS/JS (Bootstrap, Tailwind, or equivalent)
Interactive tables and charts
Dynamic sections for all existing and future releases detected in Excel
7. Automation / Extensibility
Automatically detect all release sheets (Release M.* - Response Time and Release M.* - Graph)
Populate tables and graphs per release automatically
Support future releases without manual changes
