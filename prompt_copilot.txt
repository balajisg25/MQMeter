Generate a performance test report in Excel for multiple transactions in a web application.
SLA Target: 3 seconds response time for 90% of transactions
Performance Metrics for Each Transaction:

Transaction Name (e.g., Login, Search, Checkout)

Average Response Time

90th Percentile Response Time

Max Response Time

Throughput (Transactions per second)

Error Rate (%)

CPU Usage (%)

SLA Status: Mark "Pass" if the 90th percentile is â‰¤3s, otherwise "Fail."

Recommendations:

If the 90th percentile response time exceeds 3s, suggest performance optimizations.

If CPU usage is over 80%, recommend infrastructure scaling.


Format the data into a structured Excel table with columns: Transaction Name, Avg Response Time, 90th Percentile, Max Response Time, Throughput, Error Rate, CPU Usage, SLA Status, and Recommendations.

Highlight all rows where SLA is failed (90th percentile > 3s) in red and pass results in green.

Also, generate a text summary with an overview of the transactions that exceed the SLA of 3 seconds for the 90th percentile response time and recommendations for optimization.
