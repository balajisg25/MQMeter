TASK
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by reading and rendering data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Microsoft Copilot (Microsoft 365).
The report must strictly follow the logical order, hierarchy, and structure of the Excel file.
All values must come directly from Excel or be explicitly derived as described below.
Do not assume, approximate, or fabricate any data.
SHEET DISCOVERY (NO HARDCODING)
Automatically identify and parse the following sheets by name:
consolidated
param
Any sheet whose name matches: Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Release names must be detected dynamically (for example: M1, M2, M3).
Do not hardcode any release identifiers.
If any expected sheet is missing, display a visible message in the HTML report identifying the missing sheet.
DATA SOURCES AND RULES
CONSOLIDATED SHEET (PRIMARY SUMMARY – MUST APPEAR FIRST)
Use the consolidated sheet as the homepage summary.
Render the table exactly as it appears in Excel:
Preserve row order
Preserve column order
Preserve all cell values
Preserve NA and blank cells
Do not recalculate, normalize, or modify consolidated values.
All numeric values in this sheet must be explicitly parsed as numbers.
If numeric parsing fails, display an error message in the report identifying the column.
PARAM SHEET (METADATA ENRICHMENT)
Use the param sheet only to enrich transaction data.
Columns:
Transaction Name (join key)
Functionality
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Join rules:
Join using Transaction Name
Trim leading and trailing spaces
Match case-insensitively
If no match is found, leave metadata fields blank
Do not infer or generate missing metadata
RELEASE M* – RESPONSE TIME SHEETS
For each detected release:
Read all populated rows.
Explicitly convert the following columns to numeric values:
Minimum
Average
Maximum
90th Percentile
Ignore the following columns completely:
Pass
Fail
Stop
If numeric conversion fails for any column, report the issue in the HTML instead of skipping the section.
SLA CALCULATION (DERIVED ONLY IN HTML)
SLA must not be read from Excel.
Use a fixed SLA threshold of 3 seconds.
Rules:
Under SLA: 90th Percentile is less than or equal to 3 seconds
SLA Breached: 90th Percentile is greater than 3 seconds
Apply SLA consistently to tables, charts, and observations.
HTML REPORT STRUCTURE (STRICT ORDER)
CONSOLIDATED TABLE (FIRST)
Full-width table
Sticky headers
Zebra striping
Row hover highlighting
No pagination
CONSOLIDATED BAR CHART (IMMEDIATELY AFTER TABLE)
Use only numeric response-time values
Ignore NA, blank, or non-numeric cells
X-axis: Functionalities or Transactions from consolidated sheet
Y-axis: Response Time
Color rules: Green for values less than or equal to 3 seconds Red for values greater than 3 seconds
Show hover tooltips with exact values
If no numeric data is available, display a clear message explaining why.
PER-RELEASE SECTIONS (FOR EACH DETECTED RELEASE)
PER-RELEASE SECTION – RELEASE M*
A. RESPONSE TIME AND SLA TABLE (FUNCTIONALITY GROUPED)
Data sources:
Release M* - Response Time sheet
param sheet
Grouping behavior:
Group rows by Functionality
Functionality acts as a collapsible parent section
All functionality groups must be collapsed by default
Each functionality can be expanded individually
Provide Expand All and Collapse All controls
Hierarchy: Functionality
Transaction Name (main call)
Sub-Transaction Name (sub call)
Visibility rules:
Functionality must not appear as a table column
Functionality is shown only as a group header
Table columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
URL
Minimum Response Time
Maximum Response Time
Average Response Time
90th Percentile Response Time
SLA Status
Table features:
Sticky headers
Global search
Per-column filtering
Column show/hide
Responsive layout
SLA styling:
Green for Under SLA
Red for SLA Breached
B. TOP 5 SLOWEST TRANSACTIONS
Derived from the entire release dataset
Sorted by 90th Percentile in descending order
Columns:
Transaction Name
Sub-Transaction Name
90th Percentile
SLA Status
C. TOP 5 90TH PERCENTILE BAR CHART
X-axis: Transaction or Sub-Transaction
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time
Light theme colors
Smooth animations
Hover tooltips
D. RELEASE M* – GRAPH SHEET CONTENT
Render all content from the corresponding Release M* - Graph sheet.
Preserve:
Titles
Charts
Tables
Layout order
Do not summarize, reinterpret, or alter the content.
E. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Identify all SLA breaches greater than 3 seconds
Highlight slow or degrading transactions
Provide clear, client-friendly, actionable recommendations
STYLING AND LAYOUT
100 percent browser width
No side whitespace
Light theme only
White or light-gray background
Soft blue, green, and red accents
Card-based layout
Subtle shadows
Fully responsive
CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)
No backend or Python scripting
No HTML upload controls
No hardcoded release names
SLA threshold must remain 3 seconds
Consolidated section must appear first
All detected releases must be rendered
All values must come directly from Excel or be explicitly derived
If any sheet, column, or numeric value cannot be parsed, display a visible error message in the HTML
Do not fabricate, approximate, or skip data
