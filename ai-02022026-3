Task:
Generate a single, fully self-contained, interactive, light-themed HTML performance report by reading all data from the uploaded LoadRunner Excel file in Copilot (Microsoft 365).
Requirements for Excel data handling:
Automatically detect all sheets matching:
Release M* - Response Time
Release M* - Graph
Param sheet contains metadata:
Columns: Transaction Name, Functionality, Sub-Transaction Name, URL
Use Transaction Name as primary key to enrich Release sheets.
Critical:
Trim all Transaction Name strings and normalize case before joining Param sheet.
Convert all numeric columns (Min/Max/Avg/90th) to numbers before applying logic.
If no match in Param sheet → leave Functionality, Sub-Transaction, URL blank.
SLA Status
Compute dynamically in HTML:
Under SLA → 90th Percentile Response Time ≤ 3 seconds
SLA Breached → 90th Percentile Response Time > 3 seconds
Apply SLA Status to: SLA table, Top 5 Slowest Transactions, Executive Summary
Style: Green = Under SLA, Red = SLA Breached
HTML Layout
Full browser width
Light theme: white/light-gray background, soft blue/green/red accents
Card-based layout, subtle shadows, responsive design
Tables: sticky headers, zebra stripes, row hover highlight
Homepage / Executive Summary
Total transactions per release
Average response time per release
SLA summary counts (Under SLA / Breached)
Navigation links to each release
Per-Release Section
SLA Compliance Table
Data: Release M* - Response Time enriched with Param sheet
Columns: Transaction Name, Sub-Transaction Name, URL, Min, Max, Avg, 90th, SLA Status
Tree view: Functionality → Transaction → Sub-Transaction (Functionality grouping only, not a column)
Table features: Expand/collapse all, search, per-column filter, show/hide columns, sticky headers
Top 5 Slowest Transactions
Derived from SLA table
Sorted by 90th Percentile Response Time descending
Columns: Transaction Name, Sub-Transaction Name, 90th, SLA Status
Top 5 90th Percentile Performance Graph
Bar chart of top 5 slowest transactions
X-axis: Transaction/Sub-Transaction
Y-axis: 90th Percentile Response Time (seconds)
Hover tooltips, smooth animations
Release Graph Sheet Content
Render all content from Release M* - Graph sheet exactly as in Excel (text, tables, images, charts)
Observations & Recommendations
Highlight SLA breaches (>3s)
Highlight slow transactions
Provide clear client-friendly recommendations
Debugging / Safety
Include a hidden debug section showing:
Number of rows parsed from Response Time sheet
Number of rows matched with Param sheet
Sample of numeric columns (Min/Max/Avg/90th)
This ensures data is loaded correctly and helps fix empty tables.
Deliverable
Single self-contained HTML file
Embedded or CDN-based CSS/JS
Fully interactive tables and charts
Works automatically with any number of releases (M1, M2, …)
All values must come directly from Excel or derived dynamically
No fabricated data, no backend scripts, no HTML upload controls
