Introduction (to add before prompts in your presentation)

As a Performance Testing Expert, Iâ€™m evaluating two AI models to automate and enhance performance reporting. Below are the practical prompts I use to test their capability in handling typical performance analytics tasks.


---

Scenario 1: Upload response time table and ask for report

Prompt:

> "As a performance testing expert, please analyze this response time table and provide a comprehensive summary report highlighting average, minimum, and maximum response times, along with any significant trends."




---

Scenario 2: Upload response time table and ask for response time above SLA

Prompt:

> "From a performance testing perspective, identify all response times exceeding the SLA threshold of 2 seconds, and summarize the count per service."




---

Scenario 3: Upload response time table and ask for error rate

Prompt:

> "Considering best practices in performance testing, calculate the error rate from this response time data, treating response times with 'error' status or those above 5 seconds as errors."




---

Scenario 4: Upload average response time graph and ask for analysis

Prompt:

> "Analyze this average response time graph as a performance testing specialist and explain any significant spikes or dips, including possible root causes."




---

Scenario 5: Upload Dynatrace graph and ask for analysis

Prompt:

> "Using your expertise in performance testing, review this Dynatrace graph and provide insights on system health, bottlenecks, and potential reasons for anomalies."




---

Scenario 6: Check the result file can be saved in different file formats

Prompt:

> "After generating the performance report, save the output in CSV, Excel, and PDF formats to ensure compatibility with various reporting needs."

"Create a comparison chart showing the 90th percentile response times for each transaction from LoadRunner Run 1, Run 2, and Run 3 (data from different sheets). Present the transactions on the X-axis and response times on the Y-axis, with separate series for each run. Include an SLA line at 2 seconds and highlight whether Run 3 meets the SLA for each transaction."

Analyze the LoadRunner response time graph with an SLA of 2 seconds. Identify trends, spikes, and anomalies. Correlate response time with user load, flag any SLA breaches, and suggest likely bottlenecks. Provide clear, actionable recommendations for optimization.
